# The-Imitation-Game
This project aims to train two agents to imitate the agents we have previously built from projects 1 and 2( path finding agent using A* algorithm).Chose the 4-neighbor agent from Project 1 and the Example Inference agent from Project 2 and built two ML agents that mimic its actions.Experimented with two kinds of neural network architectures (one with only Full Dense Layers and the other with at least one Convolutional Neural Layer) for each agent. The ML agents make appropriate selections in the grid world, given the current state. Evaluated and compared the ML agents against the original agents.
